Feel free to extend the list if you find a plugin for an editor not yet listed here or a better plugin for one that is already listed.

Note that you need to be careful to use flake8 for the correct Python version.

\subsection*{Visual Studio Code}

VS Code already has built-\/in support for flake8 but it needs to be enabled in the configuration. See \href{https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting}{\tt the official documentation} for instructions.

\subsection*{Vim}

\subsubsection*{Syntastic}

\href{https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic}{\tt Syntastic} is a plugin for running external style checkers that can run flake8. \begin{DoxyVerb}let g:syntastic_python_checkers = ['flake8']
" to ensure flake8 checks for python 3 code:
let g:syntastic_python_flake8_exe = 'python3 -m flake8'
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsubsection*{A\+LE}

\href{https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale}{\tt A\+LE} is a plugin for running linters asynchronously. As it runs the linter in the background, it is preferable over Syntastic, however, it needs Vim version 8 or later or Neovim.

To ensure using flake for Python 3, use the following configuration\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}let g:ale_python_flake8_executable = 'python3'
let g:ale_python_flake8_options = '-m flake8'\end{DoxyVerb}
